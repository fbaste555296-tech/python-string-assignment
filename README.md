# python-string-assignment
This Python program performs different operations on a sentence, like reversing, counting vowels, and checking palindromes. It uses a menu with options, repeats in a loop, and lets the user enter a new sentence or exit anytime.

My experience by doing this activity was well although this is my first time doing a program using python language it was much easier than java as it suggested codes that best fits to run the program smoothly. By also doing this assignment I have recalled my coding experience when using java and I also came back from the basic to learn more on how to loop because I have already forgotten on how to do it. But then again it's much fun to code in python than java.
